# The chef-repo

All installations require a central workspace known as the chef-repo. This is a place where primitive objects--cookbooks, roles, environments, data bags, and chef-repo configuration files--are stored and managed.

The chef-repo should be kept under version control, such as [git](https://git-scm.com/), and then managed as if it were source code.

For this project the chef repo is in the `cookbooks` directory 

## Knife Configuration

Knife is the [command line interface](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife/) for Chef. The chef-repo contains a .chef directory (which is a hidden directory by default) in which the knife configuration file (config.rb) is located. This file contains configuration settings for the chef-repo.

The `config.rb` file can be customized to support configuration settings used by [cloud provider options](https://docs.chef.io/plugin_knife/) and custom [knife plugins](https://docs.chef.io/plugin_knife_custom/).

Also located inside the .chef directory are .pem files, which contain private keys used to authenticate requests made to the Chef Infra Server. The USERNAME.pem file contains a private key unique to the user (and should never be shared with anyone). The ORGANIZATION-validator.pem file contains a private key that is global to the entire organization (and is used by all nodes and workstations that send requests to the Chef Infra Server).

For more information about the `config.rb` options, see the [knife](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/config_rb/) documentation.

After the VM is provisioned by Vagrant, perform the following

1. obtain the public IP of the VM
    
    * export fq=$(az network public-ip show -g testing -n jenkins-jnlp-vagrantPublicIP | jq -r '.ipAddress')

1. Bootstrap the node so it is visible to the chef.io site

    * knife bootstrap vagrant@$fq --node-name jenkins-jnlp --sudo --ssh-identity-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa --yes --ssh-verify-host-key never

## Testing

### Unit Testing with RSpec
Note we exec everything in `chef exec` as we ant to constrain this all to the chef ruby, not the global ruby

    * cd cookbooks/jenkins-jnlp
    * chef exec bundle install
    * chef exec bundle binstubs --all
    * chef exec rspec

### Integration Testing with InSpec

TBA

## Cookbooks

A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. A sample cookbook can be found in `cookbooks/starter`. After making changes to any cookbook, you must upload it to the Chef Infra Server using knife:

    $ knife upload cookbooks/jenkins-jnlp

For more information about cookbooks, see the example files in the `starter` cookbook.

## Policy

A policy file is located at `cookbooks/jenkins-jnlp/Policyfile.rb`

To generate the lockfile, execute

    $ chef install cookbooks/jenkins-jnlp/Policyfile.rb

To push the policy to the Chef server, execute

    $ knife upload 
## Roles

Roles provide logical grouping of cookbooks and other roles. A sample role can be found at `roles/starter.rb`.

## Getting Started

Now that you have the chef-repo ready to go, check out [Learn Chef](https://learn.chef.io/) to proceed with your workstation setup. If you have any questions about Chef you can always ask [our support team](https://www.chef.io/support/) for a helping hand.
